# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList renders an empty list even after a successful API call. The issue is subtle and can be difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` fetches data from an API endpoint. While the API call is successful, and the data is parsed correctly, the `FlatList` component fails to render the fetched data, resulting in an empty list.  The issue appears related to the way data is handled and possibly an asynchronous operation not correctly waiting for data.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device. 
4. Observe that the FlatList component remains empty.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data is properly updated and available to the FlatList component, using the correct lifecycle methods, or state management solutions if the situation warrants it.
